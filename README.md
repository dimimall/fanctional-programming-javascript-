# Functional Programming with Javascript 
This project is a Mars rover dashboard that consumes the NASA API. The dashboard will allow the user to select which rover's information they want to view. Once they have selected a rover, they will be able to see the most recent images taken by that rover, as well as important information about the rover and its mission.

### Project Requirements

- A gallery of the most recent images sent from each mars rover
- The launch date, landing date, name and status along with any other information about the rover
- A way for the user to choose which rover's information they want to see

- Use only pure functions
- Use at least one Higher Order Function
- Use the array method `map`
- Use the ImmutableJS library

- Make successful calls to the NASA API
